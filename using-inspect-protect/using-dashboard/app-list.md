# The Application List

The Application Listâ€Šis your entry point into the ShiftLeft UI, which displays security quality metrics and vulnerabilities resulting from ShiftLeft's static and/or runtime analysis of your applications. 

The Application List provides:

* [Access to the global Vulnerabilities Dashboard](#accessing-the-global-vulnerabilities-dashboard)
* [Snapshot of information on your applications](#snapshot-of-information-on-your-applications)
* [Drill down on an application](#drilling-down-on-an-application)
* [Deleting an application from ShiftLeft](#deleting-an-application-from-shiftleft)
* [Adding an application to ShiftLeft](#adding-an-application-to-shiftleft)

## Accessing the global Vulnerabilities Dashboard

Clicking **Vulnerabilities** from the Application List displays the [Vulnerabilities Dashboard](vulnerability-dashboard.md) for **all** your applications.

## Snapshot of Information on Your Applications

The Application List provides a snapshot of information on your applications. You can immediately see the list of applications in ShiftLeft, the number and type of vulnerabilities for each application, and if applicable, the number and type of security events for an application.

The exclamation point (!) associated with an application indicates a message. Clicking on the symbol displays information on [analysis results](view-results.md#analysis-results-notification).

The question mark (?) associated with an application, identifies an application that is currently not being monitored and secured by ShiftLeft Protect, and therefore does not include information on the number and type of security events for the application.

## Drilling Down on an Application

To find a specific application in your Application List, or narrow the applications displayed, use the **search or filter** field.

To see information on a specific application, click on the application of interest from the Application List. The [Vulnerabilities Dashboard](vulnerability-dashboard.md) for that application is opened. 

## Deleting an Application from ShiftLeft

To delete an application from ShiftLeft:

1. Click **Manage Apps**.

   A x appears for each application in the list.

To add an application to ShiftLeft:

   A page with instructions on how to add the application is displayed.
   
2. [Use the Welcome page to specify the application you want to add to ShiftLeft](../inspect-protect-quick-start.md).
