# Tagging a Build Based on Analysis Results

A build in your CI-CD pipeline can be automatically tagged based on ShiftLeft Inspect's code analysis results. You can specify a build rule for your organization to tag a build, if 

* The number of vulnerabilities crosses a specific threshold.

* At least one occurrence of a specific type of vulnerability is present in the source code.

Once you have tagged a build, the build is shown in the Version drop-down menu (you may need to refresh first), allowing you to view the analysis results for that specific build.

**The process of specifying a build rule is**:

1. [Create a filter that defines the tag criteria](filter-results.md#creating-a-filter).
2. [Save the filter](filter-results.md#saving-a-filter).
3. In the Filter Saver dialog, check **Build Rule for Org**.

     ![Tag Build Rule](img/tag-build-rule.jpg)

4. Use the following bash script, which invokes ShiftLeft's public API. 
   The script shows 1 for success if the ShiftLeft Inspect results donâ€™t have any vulnerabilities that match the build rule criteria. The script shows 0 for failure, if the build has vulnerabilities that match the build rule criteria.
