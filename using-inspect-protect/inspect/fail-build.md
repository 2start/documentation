# Failing a Build Based on Analysis Results

A build in your CI-CD pipeline can be automatically failed based on ShiftLeft Inspect's code analysis results. For example you may want to fail a build that has 

* A specific number of vulnerabilities.

* At least one occurrence of a specific type of vulnerability in the source code.

Failing a build involves creating a build rule for your organization, and then using the ShiftLeft API to verify whether an analysis result passes or fails based on the build rule. 

**To fail a build:**

1. [Create a filter that defines the fail criteria](../using-dashboard/filter-results.md#creating-a-filter).
2. [Save the filter](../using-dashboard/filter-results.md#saving-a-filter).
3. In the Save Filter dialog, check **Build Rule for Org**.

     ![Save Build Rule](img/build-rule.jpg)

4. Use the following bash script, which invokes ShiftLeft's public API. 
   The script shows 1 for success if the ShiftLeft Inspect results donâ€™t have any vulnerabilities that match the build rule criteria. The script shows 0 for failure, if the build has vulnerabilities that match the build rule criteria.
 
```bash
#!/bin/sh

set -e

PUBLIC_TOKEN=`cat token.txt`
