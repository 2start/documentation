# Securing Your Applications Using ShiftLeft Protect

ShiftLeft Protect secures applications against exploitation of vulnerabilities by leveraging "code informed" insights. ShiftLeft Protect creates runtime security specifications based on identified vulnerabilities discovered by [ShiftLeft Inspect](../../introduction/products.md) during analysis of your code. ShiftLeft Protect deploys a ShiftLeft Microagent in-memory alongside your application in production (or other environments such as staging, test, UAT). The Microagent is customized to your application's specific shape and weaknesses and connects to a ShiftLeft Proxy server to display events and metrics in the Dashboard.

## Monitoring Mode

You can use ShiftLeft Protect in monitoring mode with your IAST tool.

## Example of ShiftLeft Protect Monitoring

ShiftLeft Protect detects exploits and payload, also blocks and sanitizes, vulnerabilities. For example, vulnerabilities and exposures in the [HelloShiftLeft sample application](../../introduction/helloshiftleft.md) can be tested with API access patterns described below and through example scripts provided in the [exploits directory](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/HelloShiftLeft/tree/master/exploits). 

### Sensitive Data Leaks to Log

| URL	  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| http://<span></span>localhost:8081/customers/1 | Returns JSON representation of Customer resource based on Id (1) specified in URL |
| http://<span></span>localhost:8081/customers | Returns JSON representation of all available Customer resources |
| http://<span></span>localhost:8081/patients | Returns JSON representation of all available patients in record |
| http://<span></span>localhost:8081/account/1 | Returns JSON representation of Account based on Id (1) specified |
| http://<span></span>localhost:8081/account | Returns JSON representation of all available accounts and their details |
	
All the above requests leak sensitive medical and PII data to the logging service. In addition other endpoints such as `/saveSettings`, `/search/user`, `/admin/login` etc. are also available. Along with the list above, users can explore variations of `GET`, `POST` and `PUT` requests sent to these endpoints.

### Remote Code Execution

An RCE can be triggered through the `/search/user` endpoint by sending a `GET` HTTP request as follows:

http://<span></span>localhost:8081/search/user?foo=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder({'/bin/bash','-c','echo 3vilhax0r>/tmp/hacked'}).start()

This creates a file `/tmp/hacked` with the content `3vilhax0r`.

### Arbitrary File Write

The [filewriteexploit.py](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/HelloShiftLeft/blob/master/exploits/filewriteexploit.py) script can be executed as follows to trigger the arbritary file writing through the `/saveSettings` endpoint:

```
$ python2 filewriteexploit.py http://localhost:8081/saveSettings testfile 3vilhax0r
```

This creates a file named `testfile` with `3vilhax0r` as its contents.

### Authentication Bypass

The [exploit.py](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/helloshiftleft/blob/master/exploits/JavaSerializationExploit/src/main/java/exploit.py) script allows an authentication bypass by exposing a deserialization vulnerability which allows administrator access:

```
$ python2 exploit.py
```

This returns the following sensitive data:

```
Customer;Month;Volume
Netflix;January;200,000
Palo Alto;January;200,000
### XSS
```

A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the application and can be triggered using the **hidden** `/debug` endpoint as 

```
http://<span></span>localhost:8081/debug?customerId=1&clientId=1&firstName=a&lastName=b&dateOfBirth=123&ssn=123&socialSecurityNum=1&tin=123&phoneNumber=5432alert(1)
```

The result is an alert and returns the Customer object data.
