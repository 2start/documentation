# Securing Your Applications Using ShiftLeft Protect

ShiftLeft Protect secures applications against exploitation of vulnerabilities by leveraging "code informed" insights by creating runtime security specifications based on identified vulnerabilities discovered by [ShiftLeft Inspect](../../introduction/products.md) during analysis of your code. ShiftLeft Protect deploys a ShiftLeft Microagent in-memory alongside your application in production (or other environments such as staging, test, UAT). The Microagent is customized to your application's specific shape and weaknesses, and connects to a ShiftLeft Proxy server to display events and metrics in the [ShiftLeft Dashboard](using-dashboard/vulnerability-dashboard.md).
