# Websphere Configuration

Attaching of the agent is done though the WAS admin console at 

`Application servers > ${server_id} > Process definition > Java Virtual Machine:General Properties > Generic JVM arguments`

Agent configuration properties can be passed there too, or in:

`Additional Properties > Custom properties section`
