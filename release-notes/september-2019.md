# ShiftLeft September 2019 Updates

## ShiftLeft Ocular

**[New Tutorial on Identifying Incorrect or Zero Memory Allocation Bugs in C](..using-ocular/tutorials/c-allocation-bugs.md)** Arithmetic operations can lead to integer overflow or the arithmetic operation computes to zero. These conditions may lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. This tutorial uses ShiftLeft Ocular to determine if such a condition exists.

## ShiftLeft Dashboard

* **[Improved UI](../using-inspect-protect/using-dashboard/app-list.md)**. The ShiftLeft Dashboard has a new and improved UI that makes it easier to find, view and understand your application's vulnerabilities as found by ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect. 

* **[Filter Analysis Results](../using-inspect-protect/using-dashboard/filter-results.md)**. Instead of scrolling through a list of results, you can quickly find vulnerabilities of interest by filtering. Filters can also be saved and reused as a build rule to automatically tag a build in your CI-CD pipeline based on ShiftLeft Inspect's results.

* **[Displaying Results by Branch Name](../using-inspect-protect/using-dashboard/view-results.md#displaying-results-by-branch-name)**. If you have [included branch names from your SCM system in the analysis results of ShiftLeft Inspect](../inspect/identify-branches.md), you can now view analysis results of individual branches separately.

## ShiftLeft Inspect

* **[Tagging a Build Based on ShiftLeft Inspect Results](../using-inspect-protect/inspect/tag-build.md)**. A build in your CI-CD pipeline can now be automatically tagged based on ShiftLeft Inspect's code analysis results. 

## ShiftLeft Protect

* **[Tagging a Build Based on ShiftLeft Inspect Results](../using-inspect-protect/inspect/tag-build.md)**. A build in your CI-CD pipeline can now be automatically tagged based on ShiftLeft Inspect's code analysis results.
