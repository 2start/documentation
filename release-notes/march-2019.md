# ShiftLeft Release Notes - March 2019

## ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect

* **Vulnerability Dashboard**. The new Vulnerability Dashboard provides a singular view of application security quality metrics, including a list of vulnerabilities based on static/runtime analysis of applications. You can use these metrics to measure progress of your security improvement over time. [See the associated article](../using-inspect-protect/using-workflow/vulnerability-dashboard.md) for more information.

* **Jira Integration**. You can now integrate ShiftLeft with Jira to automatically generate Jira tickets for the vulnerabilities in your ShiftLeft Dashboard. Refer to the article [Enabling Jira Integration](../using-inspect-protect/using-workflow/jira-integration.md) for details.
