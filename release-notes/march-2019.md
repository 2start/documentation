# ShiftLeft Release Notes - March 2019

## ShiftLeft Inspect and ShiftLeft Protect

* **Vulnerabilities Dashboard**. The new Vulnerabilities Dashboard provides a singular view of application security quality metrics, including a list of vulnerabilities based on static/runtime analysis of applications. You can use these metrics to measure progress of your security improvement over time. See [Measuring Security Quality of Releases over Time](../using-inspect-protect/using-dashboard/vulnerability-dashboard.md) for more information.

* **Jira Integration**. You can now integrate ShiftLeft with Jira to automatically generate Jira tickets for the vulnerabilities in your ShiftLeft Dashboard. Refer to the article [Integrating with Jira](../using-inspect-protect/integrating-with-shiftleft/jira-integration.md) for details.
