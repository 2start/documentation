# ShiftLeft July 2019 Updates

* **Scala Support Added for all ShiftLeft Products (Beta Version)**. You can now use ShiftLeft Inspect, ShiftLeft Protect and ShiftLeft Ocular to analyze, secure and examine your Scala applications for vulnerabilities and data leakage. 

## ShiftLeft Ocular

* **Additional Documentation**. ShiftLeft Ocular documentation has been expanded. There is now information on

   * **Using ShiftLeft Ocular**. To help you understand and use ShiftLeft Ocular successfully, the following new material is provided:

      * [Technical Deep-Dive: The CPG](../using-ocular/about/cpg-deep-dive.md)
   * **Common Queries**. Content is available on the most commonly used queries to analyze:
      * [Data Flows](../using-ocular/common-queries/data-flows.md)
      * [Dependencies](../using-ocular/common-queries/dependency-analysis.md)
      * [Methods](../using-ocular/common-queries/methods-analyze.md)
      * [Method Parameters](../using-ocular/common-queries/parameters-analyze.md)
      * [Types and Packages](../using-ocular/common-queries/types-packages-analysis.md)
   * **Use Cases**. Explains how to use ShiftLeft Ocular for these use cases:

## ShiftLeft Inspect

* **Analysis Results Notification**. The first time you submit an application, or if your application has major library changes, it may take ShiftLeft Inspect a day or two to complete a full analysis. In those situations, ShiftLeft Inspect initially displays the partial analysis results, which is indicated by a message on the application's card and in the Vulnerabilities Dashboard. From this message, you can specify that you want to receive notification when the full analysis results are available.

Once ShiftLeft Inspect completes the analysis, the Vulnerabilities Dashboard message changes to indicate that the full  analysis results are now displayed and all metrics have been updated.
