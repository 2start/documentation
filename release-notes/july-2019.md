# ShiftLeft July 2019 Updates

## ShiftLeft Ocular

* **Scala Support (Early Access)**. You can now use ShiftLeft Ocular to examine your Scala applications for vulnerabilities and data leakage. As part of this early access, Scala support is available for version 2.12+.

* **Additional Documentation**. ShiftLeft Ocular documentation has been expanded! There is now [background](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/using-shiftleft-ocular/about-shiftleft-ocular) and [getting started](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/using-shiftleft-ocular/getting-started) information to help you understand and use ShiftLeft Ocular successfully, content on the most [commonly used queries](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/using-shiftleft-ocular/common-queries), explanations on how to use ShiftLeft Ocular for diverse [use cases](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/using-shiftleft-ocular/use-cases), and language-specific [tutorials](https://docs.shiftleft.io/shiftleft/using-shiftleft-ocular/tutorials).

* **[Ability to Automatically Provision Your Servers](../using-ocular/about/ocular-memory-size.md)**. You can now automate the provision of your servers to ensure that you have the required amount of memory to run ShiftLeft Ocular without impacting performance.
      
## ShiftLeft Inspect

* **Scala Support (Early Access)**. You can now use ShiftLeft Inspect to analyze your Scala applications for vulnerabilities and data leakage. As part of this early access, Scala support is available for version 2.12+.

* **[Analysis Results Notification](../using-inspect-protect/inspect/analysis-results.md)**. The first time you submit an application, or if your application has major library changes, it may take ShiftLeft Inspect a day or two to complete a full analysis. In those situations, ShiftLeft Inspect initially displays the partial analysis results, which is indicated by a message in the UI. From this message, you can specify that you want to receive notification when the full analysis results are available.

* **Vulnerability Detection Improvements**. The detection rules for vulnerabilities have been improved. Rules that resulted in too many or unclear results have been removed, especially around handling sensitive data storage and cache handling.`
