## ShiftLeft Inspect

* **Analysis Results Notification**. The first time you submit an application, or if your application has major library changes, it may take ShiftLeft Inspect a day or two to complete a full analysis. In those situations, ShiftLeft Inspect initially displays the partial analysis results, which is indicated by a message on the application's card and in the Vulnerabilities Dashboard. From this message, you can specify that you want to receive notification when the full analysis results are available.

   Once ShiftLeft Inspect completes the analysis, the Vulnerabilities Dashboard message changes to indicate that the full  analysis results are now displayed and all metrics have been updated.
