# About ShiftLeft Policies

Policies are used by ShiftLeft to identify how your application communicates with the outside world, which transformations exist on data, and which information flows should be considered security violations. Policies are also used as the basis for Security Profiles, which automate code analysis by summarizing the vulnerabilities and data leaks present in code.

ShiftLeft includes default Policies that specify the most common types of vulnerabilities. In addition, ShiftLeft Ocular users can [create custom Policies](custom-policy.md) to introduce additional knowledge about, and to exclude parts of a default Policy that does not apply to, your application.

Policies are written in the ShiftLeft [Policy Language](policy-language.md) and are identified by the filename extension `.Policy`. Policies are stored under organization-bound domains.

## Policies and ShiftLeft Ocular

When you [create and work with a CPG using ShiftLeft Ocular](../using-ocular/getting-started/create-cpg.md), Policies are automatically loaded and assigned.

ShiftLeft Ocular Policies are located in the directory

```
~/bin/ocular/policy
```

## Security Profile for Runtime (SPR)

The SPR is generated by ShiftLeft Inspect for use by ShiftLeft Protect. It specifies the vulnerabilities that the ShiftLeft Protect Microagent monitors and protects from in runtime. 

## Policies and ShiftLeft Inspect

The default or assigned Policy is automatically loaded and applied when ShiftLeft Inspect uses your application's [Code Property Graph (CPG)](../introduction/understanding-cpg.md). ShiftLeft infers the correct Policy to use, based on the source language. 

ShiftLeft Inspect Policies are located in the ShiftLeft repositiory. You access these policies using the ShiftLeft Command Line Interface (CLI).

### The Default ShiftLeft Policy

The default ShiftLeft Policy for contains directives that define and identify:

* Exposed methods, interface interactions and transformations.

* Information flows, particularly data leaks.

* Taint semantics. 

By default, Policies use a generic set of sensitive variable names, which directly affect the security results you see. To illustrate the default Policy, take a look at how  deserialization vulnerabilities are identified. The following directive

```
// [~/.shiftleft/policy/dynamic/java/io/ObjectInputStream.policy:]

IO deserialization = METHOD -f "java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject:java.lang.Object()" { INST "SINK" }
```

specifies that the instance parameter of the method `readObject` should be considered as a data sink of a deserializer, that is, the instance parameter is deserialized.

This directive determines that all parameters tagged with the Spring annotations `CookieValue`, `PathVariable`, and a few others are to be tagged as "attacker-controlled". 

```
// ~/.shiftleft/policy/dynamic/org/springframework/exposed.policy:

TAG "DATA_TYPE" -v "attacker-controlled" METHOD -a r"org\.springframework\.web\.bind\.annotation\.(Request|Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)Mapping" PAR -a r"org\.springframework\.web\.bind\.annotation\.(CookieValue|PathVariable|RequestParam|RequestBody)"
```

And this directive specifies that flows of attacker-controlled data into deserializers are worth reporting

```
// ~/.shiftleft/policy/static/execute.policy:

CONCLUSION attacker-to-deserializer = FLOW DATA (attacker-controlled) -> IO (deserializer)
WHEN CONCLUSION attacker-to-deserializer => EMIT {
    title: "Attacker controlled data to deserialization",
    description: "Attacker controlled data is deserialized in this flow. ...",
    category: "a1-injection",
    score: "8.0"
}
```

In this directive, the Policy also allows data transformations and checks to be identified in order to report flows of data, for data that does not undergo validation. 

Refer to the ShiftLeft [Policy Language](policy-language.md) for additional information and examples.

### Working with Policies with ShiftLeft Inspect

Using the CLI, you can

* View a Policy.
* List the default Policy assignment.
* Assign another Policy as the default.
* Delete the default Policy assignment.

Refer to the [CLI Reference](../using-inspect-protect/using-cli/cli-reference.md) for information.
